/**
 * AR-369: AUDIENCES config for `area_brief`. The marquee composite tool
 * shapes its output by audience: lender, insurer, retailer, investor.
 *
 * Each entry says:
 *   - which scoring preset to call /v1/score?explain=true with
 *   - which dimension labels to emphasise in the brief
 *   - which raw signal keys to highlight, grouped by section
 *
 * Server-side narrative policy: nothing here invents prose. Every
 * "highlight" is just selection — which real field from the response
 * renders in which section. The score's `summary`, `recommendations`,
 * per-dimension `reasoning` + `confidence_reason` all come from the
 * engine; the audience config decides *which* of them surface.
