# Architecture Decision Records

Short, durable records of the load-bearing decisions in the signal-first
restructure (and beyond). Each ADR captures the *context*, the *decision*, and
the *consequences* so future contributors (and future us) understand the *why*,
not just the *what*. See `EXECUTION-PLAYBOOK.md` §4.

Format: one file per decision, `NNNN-short-slug.md`, numbered in order. A
decision is never edited away once superseded; instead a later ADR supersedes it
and both are kept (the trail matters).
